                            <h5>By ordering from CakeyHand you agree to the following Terms & Conditions.</h5> 
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    If you choose to order online through our website, full payment will be required in order to
                                    place the order. If you choose to place the order through other ways, such as direct social 
                                    media messaging or telephone calls, we will ask 50% of the total as a deposit in order to confirm
                                    your order. The reason of asking a deposit is because we may have had accepted other clients'
                                    orders in case you decide to cancel the order.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Delivery option is available for all your purchases. However, in some cases we may ask extra
                                    $5 CAD as a delivery fee. Only the orders over $100 CAD and to be delivered within St. John's 
                                    qualify for a free delivery. For all other cases, which includes but not limited to orders less
                                    than $100 CAD or outside of St. John's, we charge extra $5 CAD. Please also be informed that the 
                                    delivery option is available only within Newfoundland
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    You are free to choose pick up instead of delivery in which case there are no any additional charges.
                                    Both for delivery and pick up option, we will communicate the places and times to hand you over 
                                    your order
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Please ensure someone is available at the delivery address on the day of your order; if there is no-one 
                                    on hand to receive the order we will do our very best to leave them in a safe place (with a neighbour, 
                                    receptionist, caretaker etc.) but we cannot keep hold of the cakes/desserts/cupcakes for re-delivery 
                                    and they will be left at the address you have given us. If you would like us to deliver to 
                                    your place of work we are happy to do so but please note that CakeyHand cannot accept any liability for the treatment of your order or mishandling once a delivery has been made
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Because product freshness is our #1 priority, we make our products only when the order is placed.
                                    This is why we require a minimum quantity and a minimum advance notice for each product. Depending
                                    on how much time consuming the product is the miniumum quantity and minimum advance notice may vary.
                                    You can find that information by hovering your mouse over the product or if you're using the mobile
                                    browser you can simpy tap on the white space of the product and will show you the information. If you
                                    have an urgent matter and the website is not allowing you to place the order because of the above 
                                    mentioned restrictions, we suggest you to directly contact us and depending our schedule we will do 
                                    our best to satisfy your request
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If arranging your own collection we would advise always booking a car, rather than a motorbike. 
                                    Once cakes are handed over we can not be held liable for any damage that occurs on transit. 
                                    Any issues should be handled directly with the courier company you have chosen to use. 
                                    We do not accept returns. Refunds or a replacement order to the same value will be given 
                                    only in the event that you receive the incorrect product or if the products are shown to be 
                                    of unsatisfactory quality. Should this be the case, or if you are in any way unsatisfied with 
                                    the condition or quality of your cakes upon arrival you must contact us within 24 hours of receipt.
                                    CakeyHand will not accept liability for any complaints made after this time.

                                    We reserve the right to use photographs of orders we prepare on our website, blog, Instagram 
                                    pages and Facebook pages. If you would like to specifically request that we do not use pictures 
                                    of your order, or that we provide you with a picture of your order we will usually be happy 
                                    to do so but you must let us know at the time of ordering.

                                    If you need to change the date or details of your order or cancel it altogether please 
                                    contact us as far in advance as possible. Telephone and online orders cancelled 4 days 
                                    or more before the delivery/collection date will receive a full refund on the order total; 
                                    those cancelled within 2 days of delivery/collection will be entitled to a 50% refund; 
                                    those cancelled within 48 hours of the order date will not be entitled to a refund 
                                    (although refunds may still be provided at CakeyHand's discretion).
